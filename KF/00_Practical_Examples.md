Practical Example:
Imagine you have a local service running on your machine, managed by the local NetGet instance. You want this service to be accessible via a specific domain (e.g., service.example.com) that points to your public-facing main.netget.me. When a user accesses service.example.com, the request hits main.netget.me, which then securely forwards the request to your local NetGet, which in turn directs the request to the correct local service.

This architecture allows you to extend your local development environment to the web seamlessly, enabling scenarios where developers can share local services without exposing their entire local network to the internet, maintaining security and control while benefiting from global accessibility.

By leveraging NetGet in both local and remote contexts, developers gain a powerful toolset that simplifies the complexity of digital network management, echoing the simplicity and control musicians enjoy with their guitar pedals.
