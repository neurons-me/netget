To uninstall NGINX on macOS using Homebrew, you would use the following command:

bash
Copy code
brew uninstall nginx
This command tells Homebrew to remove the NGINX package from your system. If you installed NGINX with additional options or used it extensively, you might also want to check for any remaining configuration files or logs and remove them manually to clean up all traces. Typically, NGINX configuration files are located in /usr/local/etc/nginx or /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx depending on your system setup.

To remove these directories and any logs, you could run:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf /usr/local/etc/nginx
rm -rf /usr/local/var/log/nginx
Or if you are using a newer Mac with Apple Silicon and Homebrew is installed in /opt/homebrew, the commands would be:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx
rm -rf /opt/homebrew/var/log/nginx

To uninstall NGINX from a Debian-based system, you typically use the apt-get command to remove the installed packages. Here's how you can do it:

Remove the NGINX Package: This command will uninstall NGINX but keep the configuration files in case you reinstall NGINX later.
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get remove nginx nginx-common
Purge NGINX: If you also want to delete configuration files and other related data, use the purge option. This action is irreversible and removes all configuration files along with the package.
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get purge nginx nginx-common
Autoremove: After uninstalling, you might have dependencies that were installed with NGINX and are no longer needed. Clean up these unnecessary packages with:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get autoremove
Check if NGINX is Still Running: Before or after uninstalling, you might want to ensure that all NGINX processes are stopped. You can do this with:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl stop nginx
Check for Remaining Configuration Files: If you're concerned about leftover files (especially if you only used remove), you can manually check and delete any remaining NGINX configuration files typically found in /etc/nginx.
bash
Copy code
sudo rm -rf /etc/nginx
By following these steps, you can fully uninstall NGINX from a Debian-based Linux system.
