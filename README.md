# NetGet
> **Build, Expose, Route â€” Effortlessly.**
---

## **Global Installation - (System-wide CLI)**
Global installation sets up **NetGet** system-wide, providing access to its **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for configuring network routes and exposing services.

**Installation:**

> **Compatible with Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS).**

```bash
npm i -g netget
```

**Start NetGet on your Terminal by running:**

```bash
netget
```

## **Flow Overview**

When **NetGet** is installed on your server, it binds to your **public IP** and starts listening for **HTTP** and **HTTPS** traffic.

You use the NetGet **CLI** to register your **domains and subdomains**, specifying where each one should route â€” either to an internal service (via port) or to a static folder.

All incoming requests are:

- Automatically redirected from **HTTP to HTTPS** for secure connections.
- Matched against the **registered domains**.
- Routed to the appropriate **port** or **static content** youâ€™ve defined.

NetGet also manages your **SSL certificates**, issuing and renewing them automatically so you donâ€™t have to worry about HTTPS setup.

### Example Use Case
Suppose you own example.com, and you want to:

1. Route https://example.com to a **static folder** serving a React web interface.
2. Point api.example.com to a **backend service** exposing your API.

With **NetGet**, you can manage this â€” and **as many domains and subdomains as needed** â€” from a single interface.

Simply point your domain(s) to your serverâ€™s IP address, then use the NetGet CLI to:

- Route **example.com** to your React build directory.
- Forward **api.example.com** to the port where your API is running.

**NetGet will automatically handle SSL certificates** for all configured endpoints.

> Just ensure your applications are actively running on the ports defined in NetGet â€” it will take care of the routing, HTTPS encryption, and traffic flow.

------

## **Port Management**
NetGet includes a built-in **Port Management** module to help you monitor, inspect, and free up ports directly from the CLI.

**To access:**
```bash
netget
```

Navigate to **Port Management** using the arrow keys.

### Available Actions:
- **Inspect Port**: See which process is using a specific port, with PID and service info.
- **Kill Process on Port**: Free a blocked or stuck port by terminating the process.

Gain full visibility and control over your deviceâ€™s port allocation and traffic routing.

------

## **Summary**
Whether you're a solo developer or managing infrastructure at scale, **NetGet** provides a unified way to expose local services, manage traffic, and build modular, decentralized architectures â€” with ease, flexibility, and security.
