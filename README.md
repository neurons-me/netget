# netget
mLearning - Lisa

There is no use in server / client communication model anymore.
Monads are both server && client and that's all they are.
Everything else are just modules.

We will be using netget as our communication protocol module but
then again everything can be used.

Technologies used:
- websockets
- nodejs
