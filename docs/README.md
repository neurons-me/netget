# NetGet

### Unleash the Cyberspace Within

**NetGet** streamlines the orchestration of digital domains with the simplicity of a pedal's press, enabling seamless symphonies across networked realms. This **modular gateway framework,** designed for Node.js applications, acts as a dynamic conduit, **directing internet traffic to local services** with unparalleled ease. Inspired by the vast digital landscapes of cyberpunk lore, NetGet empowers developers to manage and expand their digital footprints without the complexities traditionally associated with network configurations.

## Installation

Install NetGet via npm:

```bash
npm install netget
```

## Usage

Import NetGet in your Node.js application:

```js
import { Gateway } from 'netget';
// Initialize and configure your Gateway
const gateway = new Gateway();
gateway.listen();
```

Now you can:

```bash
npm start
```

Your main application and the gateway will be hosted at localhost.

## Configuration

NetGet relies on a `domains.json` file for routing configuration, structured as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "YourDomainConfigName",
  "domains": {
    "example.com": "exampleHandler",
    "anotherdomain.com": "anotherHandler"
  }
}
```

Each domain key maps to a handler module that exports a function to handle requests for that domain.

By default, NetGet searches for a `domains.json` configuration in the `./config` directory, streamlining the setup process.



**NetGet** is particularly useful in environments where multiple services or applications must be accessible through a single entry point, commonly known as a **reverse proxy setup.**

### Scalable Web Services

In a microservices architecture, **NetGet can route requests to different services** within your infrastructure, making it an ideal solution for developers looking to scale their applications horizontally. Each service can have its own domain, and **NetGet** will ensure that requests are forwarded to the correct service.

### Personal Hosting Solutions

For personal web hosting, **NetGet** provides an **easy-to-set-up gateway** for routing traffic to various self-hosted applications. Users with several web applications running on a home server can use **NetGet** to manage access to these applications through different domains.

### Secure Access Control

Combined with authentication layers, NetGet can control access to various parts of a web infrastructure, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific services.

### Simplified Configuration

With NetGet, the complexity of setting up a domain routing system is abstracted away. Users can define their routing logic in a simple JSON configuration file, making the management of domain routes straightforward and maintainable.

### Dynamic Load Balancing

NetGet can be extended to include load balancing capabilities, distributing incoming requests across multiple instances of a service to balance the load and improve performance.

By using **NetGet,** developers and system administrators can create a more organized and efficient network topology, where the flow of requests is handled systematically, aligning with the concept of futuristic control and management of digital spaces.

Remember to replace placeholders like `YourDomainConfigName`, `example.com`, `exampleHandler`, etc., with the actual data relevant to your package.
