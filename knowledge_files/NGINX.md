The difference between "reload" and "restart" in the context of managing a service like NGINX involves the scope and impact of the operation:

Restart
Definition: Restarting NGINX means stopping the service completely and then starting it again.
Usage: This operation is typically used when you need to apply changes that cannot be dynamically reloaded, such as changes to the main configuration file (nginx.conf) or other fundamental changes that require the entire service to be restarted.
Impact: Restarting will temporarily stop NGINX, causing a brief downtime. All active connections will be terminated, and new connections will be possible only after NGINX starts again.
Command Examples:

Linux/macOS: sudo systemctl restart nginx
Windows (nssm): nssm restart nginx
Reload
Definition: Reloading NGINX means reloading the configuration files without stopping the service.
Usage: This operation is useful for applying configuration changes that can be dynamically applied without stopping the service, such as changes to site-specific configuration files or changes in the http, server, or location blocks.
Impact: Reloading is less disruptive compared to restarting because it does not stop the service. NGINX will re-read the configuration files and apply the new settings, but existing connections will not be terminated.
Command Examples:

Linux/macOS: sudo nginx -s reload
Windows (nssm): This might not be directly applicable since reloading is more of a native feature in Unix-like systems.
Practical Examples
When to Use Reload:

You added a new virtual host or updated an existing one.
You changed the settings in a location block or updated SSL/TLS certificates.
When to Use Restart:

You changed the main configuration file (nginx.conf).
You installed or updated NGINX itself.
You need to reset the service due to unexpected issues or errors that a reload doesn't resolve.
