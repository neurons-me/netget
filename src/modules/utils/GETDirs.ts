/* Safety and Non-Destructive Behavior
No Deletion or Overwriting: The script does not contain any commands to delete or overwrite files or directories.
 The fs.mkdirSync() function only creates directories; it does not modify or delete existing files or directories.
Preservation of Existing Content: If a directory already exists, fs.mkdirSync() with { recursive: true } does nothing to that directory or its contents. 
It simply moves on without changing anything in the existing directory structure.*/
